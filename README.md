# Asteroids Game
-Asteroids was one of my first projects!

This repository contains a Python script that builds a simple video game based on the classic **[Asteroids](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asteroids_(video_game))**.

This project was created in collaboration with **[Boot.Dev](https://boot.dev)**.
